Mutable:

Mutable objects can change their value but keep their id(). See also immutable.

Imputable:
An object with a fixed value. Immutable objects include numbers, strings and tuples. 
Such an object cannot be altered. A new object has to be created if a different value has to be stored. 
They play an important role in places where a constant hash value is needed, for example as a key in a dictionary
